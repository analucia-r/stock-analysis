# stock-analysis
# Overview of project
We used a sequence of instructions defined as macros to run funcions and commands while reducing time while compleating the project. Also, with the use of macros it was possible to retireve and extract data from different worksheets. During the stock analysis. Steve wanted to calculate the total daily volume and total yearly return. To begin proggrammng a macro on visual basic we included loops, nested loops, conditionals statments,  and messaege box function. All of the listed items created a macro where we could run getting the results and have results comparing two different years evaluating over 3 thousand rows and increasing the volume of them using the funcion i = rowstart To rowend and defining the variables after also defning what sheet we are using. It was important to know how to create conditional statements inside nested loops where there could be runned and answers were given if either or conditions were true per specific type of stocks.

For both years you use the work sheet where we declare what type of ticker to look for, the daily volume and the percent of return where we must activiate the type of worksheet depening on the years and calculating the total volume. 2017 had a much higher rate of return compared to 2018. The avergae rate of return for 2017 was 67.3% comparing to the price difference starting from the beggining to the end of the year. The code provided made the code run more effiently. We suggest that Steve's parents don't use or continure to invest in DOQ but rather invest in ENPH or RUN that have higher rates of retun. Finally comparing the two years ENPH had a better stock and a better increase. 

# Summary
Reactoring code is easier to understand, modify and be more functional. The code design was improved by to make it easier to extend the code. It was imporant to replace code and have less of it. while reducing code it makes it less complex while understanding coding logic. From the original VBA script to the new one was that it saved time. The disadvantges would be when a code is extreamly long there is more risk in coding incorrectly.
